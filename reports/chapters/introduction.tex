It is become harder and harder to understand disease patterns, particularly those associated with respiratory dissease \cite{Zimlich}. The dynamic character of these patterns, which change over time, is the source of this issue. As such, it becomes difficult to understand these patterns precisely, which results in insufficient preventative measures and therapies, which in turn encourages the spread of these diseases. Different pulmonary X-ray pictures are frequently used in the investigation of these conditions. Rising pollution levels and deteriorating public health conditions—which are predicted to get worse over time—are the main causes of the rise in these diseases. Massive outbreaks could eventually result from these conditions; one example of this is the Covid-19 virus \cite{WHO}, which mostly attacks the lungs and spreads quickly among people in close proximity. Pandemic scenarios make manual analysis more challenging. But still Predictive modeling is one workable substitute. When compared to manual validation, these models allow for faster and more efficient analysis across several sites.



\section{Background}
\label{sec:into_back}

In this research paper, complex predictive modeling is performed which will be based on a 
machine learning algorithm where the chosen algorithm will be based upon deep learning 
technique, and the input dataset \cite{Kaggle} of the model is based upon different lung X-rays 
which are collected over different periods and are annotated with four different respiratory 
that are “Bacterial Pneumonia”, “Corona Virus Disease”, “Normal”, “Tuberculosis”, “Viral 
Pneumonia”. The all above-mentioned diseases can be easily spread and can cause a massive 
pandemic in the future, and since the current research question is if the predicting model 
helps understand the pattern of the disease therefore four diseases are sufficient to analyze 
and the performance of the given model will be governed using different classification metric  
\cite{sultana2021using} available. The research will consist of a deep analysis of previous research 
conducted and the use of Python language to train and analyze the predictive model.

\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:intro_prob_art}
How can the implementation of machine learning algorithms, utilizing historical health data, 
achieve a minimum accuracy of 90 percent in predicting the onset of infectious disease outbreaks 
within a specific population by the end of the next academic year, and what impact does the 
timely intervention resulting from these predictions have on mitigating the spread and severity 
of the outbreaks?

\section{Aims and objectives}
\label{sec:intro_aims_obj}


\textbf{Aims:} This study uses machine learning and historical health data from a specific Population to predict infectious disease outbreaks with an accuracy of 90 percent.  

\textbf{Objectives:} The project's objective is to use machine learning for early disease detection, resource optimization, and improved patient outcomes include integrating various healthcare data sources, putting predictive models into practice that work, The program seeks to effectively integrate into current healthcare workflows for real-world use.

Briefly describe the solution approach and the methodology applied in solving the set aims and objectives.

Depending on the project, you may like to alter the ``heading'' of this section. Check with you supervisor. Also, check what subsection or any other section that can be added in or removed from this template.

\subsection{A subsection 1}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub1}
You may or may not need subsections here. Depending on your project's needs, add two or more subsection(s). A section takes at least two subsections. 

\subsection{A subsection 2}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub2}
Depending on your project's needs, add more section(s) and subsection(s).

\subsubsection{A subsection 1 of a subsection}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub1}
The command \textbackslash subsubsection\{\} creates a paragraph heading in \LaTeX.

\subsubsection{A subsection 2 of a subsection}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub2}

Describe the outline of the rest of the report here. Let the reader know what to expect ahead in the report. Describe how you have organized your report. 

\textbf{Example: how to refer a chapter, section, subsection}. This report is organised into seven chapters. Chapter~\ref{ch:lit_rev} details the literature review of this project. In Section~\ref{ch:method}...  % and so on.

\textbf{Note:}  Take care of the word like ``Chapter,'' ``Section,'' ``Figure'' etc. before the \LaTeX command \textbackslash ref\{\}. Otherwise, a  sentence will be confusing. For example, In \ref{ch:lit_rev} literature review is described. In this sentence, the word ``Chapter'' is missing. Therefore, a reader would not know whether 2 is for a Chapter or a Section or a Figure.
